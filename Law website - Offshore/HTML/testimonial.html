        <h1>CONSUMER PROTECTION </h1>
    <p>I regularly advise clients on used-automobile "lemon laws" which fall under the Consumer Protection Act.
        The best success stories are those cases which are able to settle after an initial demand letter is sent to avoid the necessity of trial. Here, 
        the clients are generally without a working vehicle or are scared to drive a defective vehicle so a quick turnaround is important.
         I have sent successful demand letters to both small "shady" dealerships as well as the large corporate dealers with success. 
         I have had dealers make the necessary repairs, accept the vehicle as a trade-in towards a new vehicle at a reduced sale price, and refund the complete purchase price.

    <h1>EMPLOYMENT LAW</h1>
    <P> Client “SK” filed a charge of discrimination based on race with the Massachusetts <br> Commission Against
        Discrimination. We attended an investigative conference and <br> submitted a response to the employer’s position statement.
        We brought the matter <br> to MCAD-facilitated mediation after determining that the employer was giving <br> negative references 
        to potential employers for over a year and a half, and SK received <br> $15,000 in settlement,as well as a written agreement 
        that the employer would only <br> verify the dates of SK’s employment to prospective employers. After this settlement <br> agreement,
         SK was able to obtain full-time employment within two months.

            <h1>TENANT LAW</h1>
            <p>  A tenant on assistance in New Bedford got her housing assistance taken away. As a result, she owed over $6,000.00 in rent. 
                I was able to negotiate a reasonable move-out date for her, get all of her back rent waived, and even got her $500.00 to help with the move.
                 She was thrilled. She paid me a small fee and owed me $100 when all was said and done. However the same day that we appeared in court she got her GED,
                  so I waived the remainder of my fee as a “graduation present.” I didn't think much of it, but she began crying and gave me a big hug on the courthouse steps.

        <h1>FAMILY LAW</h1>
        <P> 

            A Medfield client had litigated a divorce modification pro se and lost the case. The judgment  <br>contained 
                            scathing commentary about him and a suspended jail sentence if he failed to pay <br> on time and in full as  the
                             court had ordered. The client had a payment due that he could not <br> afford and sought legal assistance  from 
                             Justice Bridge to determine his options. After a <br> detailed  review of the documents and significant  consultation
                              with the client,  the client <br> sought financial help from various sources to secure some sort  of payment. I then 
                              negotiated <br> different payment terms with the opposing party's attorney and  succeeded in part because a  <br>payment was available. 
                              A stipulation was then filed with the court.
